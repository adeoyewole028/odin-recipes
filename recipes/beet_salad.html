      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        I was looking for a way to use raw beets and found a recipe online. I
        changed it a bit to use ingredients that I grow and use. It's so yummy
        and is so nutritious because the nutrition isn't cooked out of the
        beets. Everyone that has tried it, likes it. It's better if let set for
        a few hours but doesn't have to be. Serve for a cold lunch with boiled
        eggs on a bed of lettuce.
