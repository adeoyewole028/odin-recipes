      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor of
        rice and chicken. Chicken is first sauteed on the stove top to produce a
        wonderful aromatic base for the rice. For an extra special and authentic
        touch, serve jollof rice with fried plantains.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredient</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
          1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1
          teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix
          well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5
          minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle
          simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain
          cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid.
          Discard solids.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle
          and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read
          thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F
          (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat
          and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5
          minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and
          infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de
          Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice.
          Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
          Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and
          creamy, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add
          plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3
          minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with
          friend plantains and serve with chicken.
        </li>
